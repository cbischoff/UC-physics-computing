## 1. Install anaconda python distrobution

The first step is to get your computer set up to run python in a Jupyter notebook environment. Python is a general purpose programming language that is widely used for data analysis. There are many ways to install python, but I suggest installing the [Anaconda python distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) which includes not only the basic python interpreter but also a wide selection of modules that are useful for scientific computing. Follow that link to download and install Anaconda.

Next, you are going to test that you can start up and run Jupyter notebooks and also check that some important python modules are installed.

First, download this Jupyter notebook file: [test_python_environment.ipynb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbischoff/UC-physics-computing/main/test_python_environment.ipynb) (i.e. right-click or ctrl-click and "Save As")

When you installed Anaconda, that should provide a launcher program called "Anaconda Navigator". When you run Anaconda Navigator, you should get a window similar to the one shown below. Find the pane for Jupyter Notebook and select the Launch button (circled below in red).

Launching Jupyter notebook will open a new tab in your web browser that lets you browse through files on your computer. Navigate to the Jupyter notebook file, `test_python_environment.ipynb`, that you downloaded. Clicking on this file will run the Jupyter notebook in a new tab.
